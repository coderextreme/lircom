have a incrementally built finite state automata
to describe the logs.
have a push down automata to describe the state
of the stacks.

for version space algebra, build the programs tree,
then look down the tree of if statements looking
for similarities, if you can find repititions along
one branch, make it recursive, and trim the tree.

You will then merge the branches off the main branch
by reconstructing if statements.
