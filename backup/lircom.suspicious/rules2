Phase 2a:
Pick any face up card from any of stacks 1 through 7
and place on a stack 1 through 7 where the suit is the
opposite color and the rank is one greater than the
card being played

Phase 2b:
Pick up a king and play it on an empty stack 1 through 7

Phase 2c:
A set of adjacent face up cards on a stack may be treated as a
unit and played like the bottom card in Phase 2a and 2b.  Thus
a 2 and Ace may be played on a 3 and a King and Queen may
be played on an empty stack.  The top card must be included
in this move.

Phase 2d:
A card may be picked from the waste or the stacks and played
on the foundation, starting with Ace and ascending through
the rank (no skips or repeats), while maintaining suit.  The
last card played on the foundation is the king.

Phase 2e:
A card may be played from the deck onto the waste.  A card
may be played from the waste to the foundation or the stacks.

Phase 2f:
If the deck is empty, the waste may be turned over to form
a new deck.

Phase 3:
Game is over when all cards are played to the foundation.
