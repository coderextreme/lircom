	(Alternatively, move top 3 cards from talon to the waste, or fewer if
		there aren't 3 cards in the talon)
	Move any face up top card to working stacks, if the card below the
		moved card is the face up top card and is opposite color and one
		greater than the card being moved.
	Move a face up ace on top of a stack to final stack if the final stack
		is empty.
	Move any face up card on top of a stack to final stack if final stack
		has a top card one less than the moved card, and the suits are
		the same.
	Move a king from the waste or final to empty working stack if the king
		is the top card of waste or final.
	Move a neighboring set of cards on a working stack including the top
		card, not including any face down card to another working stack
		if target stack has a face up top card one greater than the
		bottom moved card, and the suits are of opposite color.
	Move a neighboring set of cards on a working stack including the top
		card,a with the bottom card a face up king, not including any
		face down card to another working stack if target stack is
