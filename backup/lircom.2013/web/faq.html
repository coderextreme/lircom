<h2>LirCom Chat Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<h3>How do I start using the program?</h3>
<p>
You need to either use
<a href="http://schizophrenics.net/yottzumm/lircom/lircom.pl">
	this link for Windows Internet Explorer
</a>.  Or use
 <a href="http://schizophrenics.net/yottzumm/lircom/lircom.jnlp">
	this link for all other systems and browsers.
</a>
Basically you need one or the other.  You also need the Java Runtime
Environment 5.0 from <a href="http://java.com">http://java.com</a>
If you are on a Mac, you should be directed to a page which allows
you to download J2SE 5.0 or JRE 5.0 for Tiger.  If you're not using Tiger,  I give
up.  You'll have to use another way to get into the chat room.  There
are good ways to use the chat rooms supported by this chat, they just
take more effort.  I suggest you use X-Chat or X-Chat Aqua.
</p>
<p>
After launching and downloading the chat program and passing the dreaded
security window--the only reason I don't have nicer message is that it costs
$500 for a nicer message, you need to enter a nickname.  I suggest a
9 character or less name that uniquely identifies you.  Sometimes, there
are invalid characters you can't use.  Please use numbers letters and underscores, and you should be safe.  If you collide with someone elses name,
then the program will try to give you a slightly different nickname.
Hopefully this will be sufficient.
</p>
<p>
After that it will prompt you for an IRC url, that starts with irc://
You can say okay here.  This is the default choice in another window.
</p>
<p>
The next two windows are the main chat window (in the center) and the
IRC Connection Info (in the upper left).  I want you to focus on the
IRC Connection Info now.  The first thing is a button that you will
hit last.  But if your hyperactive, you can hit it first.  It willt
take you to the site you entered in the previous window.  The next
thing is a pull down that allows you to choose from various sites.
You can override any of the values.  If a site requires a password,
you must type that site's password, which you have gotten from that
other site.  Not therunestone.org password.  The one example of this
we have right now is schizophrenia.com at IP address 66.160.133.190.
You'll have to get a password from <a href="http://schizophrenia.com">
http://schizophrenia.com</a>.  The other rooms we have so far don't
have passwords, unless you've specifically set one up.  There are no
guarantees that my chat will allow you to enter that password,
because I'm not familiar with them.  I recommend using the chat
client you used to get the password in the first place.
</p>
<p>
After you've entered the rest of the information, which you shouldn't
have to do if you've selected one of the sites from the pull down, hit
the Connect to IRC.  If everything goes well, and there are people
in the room, on the main window, you will see a list of chatters on
the right, and your blue join message in the larger area.  If nothing goes
well, nothing will change.  But allow the computer time to connect
to the chat network (java is slow).  You should type where it says
"type here" (erase it first).  Complete your message with the ENTER or
RETURN key press. If you wish to focus your chatting on one specific
person, select that person's name from the list.  The message should
only go to them.  If it goes to other people, then notify the management.
</p>
<p>
In general, the main IRC commands will work, but it's easier to click
on who you want to receive the message, and type your message in.  If
you want to select a room to send to, that starts with a #, do that.
If you want to disconnect someone type CTRL-Click on the PC, and
Apple-Click on the Macintosh.
</p>
<p>
Good luck!

<h3>What's the menu for</h3>
<p>
That is for experimental features, and should not be used by the general
population.  This is kind of my own hobby, so I've built a lot of hobbiest
features into the chat, which you probably shouldn't use.  Especially don't
use the solitaire feature, which will probably get you banned from the chat
room.
</p>
<h3>What is this solitaire thing?</h3>
<p>
Don't try it unless you are disconnected.  The computer plays a game
of solitaire by default.
</p>
<h3>What are those numbers in the text?</h3>
<p>
Those are mIRC colors.  The package (martyr) I am using to do IRC doesn't
have a way to give me mIRC colors, so I will have to do the parsing
myself, which I haven't done yet.
</p>
<h3>How come receiving actions (/me) doesn't work?</h3>
<p>
Because the package I am using doesn't create a separate way to receive
actions.  I will have to parse the message (which I haven't done yet).
However, out going actions do work, to my knowledge.
